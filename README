---------
A simple, portable tool for measuring SMTP server delay, delay variation 
and throughput.

COMPILING ON *NIX
-----------------
Building on *NIX can be done manually using a C++ compiler such as GNU's 
'g++' or by using 'cmake'. It could be easily ported to a Makefile.

	$ cmake .
	$ make

COMPILING ON MAC OS X
---------------------
There is a Makefile you can run using 'make', which will tell you to use
'cmake' instead. Simply type
	
	$ make osx

to build using Mac OSX-optimized settings.

COMPILING ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS
------------------------------
A project file for Dev-C++ is included, should be quite portable to eg. VS.
